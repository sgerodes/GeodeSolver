        # and instead make a group of the entire old cluster.

        # to add all pumpkins from a cluster to the current group such that the other cluster can form its own
        # group if its size is less than the MAX_GROUP_SIZE.
        # If that's not possible, and one of the clusters requires more than MAX_GROUP_SIZE blocks to reach
        # all pumpkins, we can add some of those blocks to the current group to hopefully reduce the required
        # number of blocks to equal or below MAX_GROUP_SIZE

        # To check if a bridge is useless (i.e. all pumpkins that were reachable are still reachable after
        # disabling the bridge), we can run BFS with one bridge disabled each time and see if all pumpkins
        # are still reachable
        # Before running BFS for all bridges, we can instead make some optimizations that are faster to compute.

        # 1. For all pumpkins with only one neighbour where the neighbour is a bridge, the bridge is mandatory
        # 2. For all bridges with only one neighbour, the bridge is useless
        # 3. For the newly created clusters, if only one of the neighbours of the added block is part of the
        #    cluster, then trace a path from that neighbour until it branches or until all pumpkins are found.
        #    All bridges on this path are mandatory.
        #    # Optimization: For the 'forced' path, you can always explore pumpkins before bridges
        #                    If BFS runs end up being necessary you run those starting from the first
        #                    branching point.

        # If there are still bridges for which the state is undetermined, then you first run a BFS from the
        # final block of the mandatory path to determine the distances to all remaining pumpkins.
        # Then, for all undetermined bridges, you mark the bridge as unnecessary, run the BFS again from the
        # final block. If the distance to any of the pumpkins increases (possibly to infinite), the bridge
        # is necessary.
        # This doesn't necessarily achieve the optimal layout but can't massively mess up
        # Over-optimization: You can make subclusters while determining the distance to the remaining
        #                    pumpkins to decrease the BFS search space
