        # disabling the bridge), we can run BFS with one bridge disabled each time and see if all pumpkins
        # are still reachable
        # Before running BFS for all bridges, we can instead make some optimizations that are faster to compute.

        # 2. For all bridges with only one neighbour, the bridge is useless
        # 3. For the newly created clusters, if only one of the neighbours of the added block is part of the
        #    cluster, then trace a path from that neighbour until it branches or until all pumpkins are found.
        #    All bridges on this path are mandatory.
        #    # Optimization: For the 'forced' path, you can always explore pumpkins before bridges
        #                    If BFS runs end up being necessary you run those starting from the first
        #                    branching point.

        # Then, for all undetermined bridges, you mark the bridge as unnecessary, run the BFS again from the
        # final block. If the distance to any of the pumpkins increases (possibly to infinite), the bridge
        # is necessary.
